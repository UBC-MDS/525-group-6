## Introduction

In this project, our objective is to get familiar with processing datasets and constructing machine learning models at scale. We will be working with a dataset containing daily precipitation data from New South Wales (NSW), Australia, covering the years from 1889 to 2014. The dataset is derived from CMIP6, a global cooperative initiative that brings together climate modeling outputs from various research groups.

The dataset comprises 6 columns, which represent timestamps, spatial data, and rainfall amounts (in mm/day). Our initial task (milestone 1) involves consolidating the modelled datasets into a single CSV file to facilitate subsequent processing. As the project progresses, we anticipate developing and deploying ensemble machine learning models in the cloud to forecast daily rainfall in Australia based on the dataset. The dataset features outputs from multiple climate models, with the actual rainfall observation as the target variable.

We have sourced the dataset from figshare, and our ultimate aim is to develop an ensemble model that leverages these outputs and compare its predictions with the actual rainfall data. By the end of the project, we aim to have a cloud-deployed machine learning model available for public use.
